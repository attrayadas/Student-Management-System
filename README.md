It is a console-based ***Java Application*** which helps in managing course enrollments and balance information for the students.

**The Application does the following:**

* Asks the user how many new students will be added to the database
* The user is prompted to enter the name and year for each students
* Every student gets a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
* A student can enroll in multiple courses like:

   _Java,_

   _Python,_

   _JavaScript,_

   _Go,_

   _Ruby, etc_

* Each course costs $200 to enroll

* The student can be able to view their balance and pay the tuition amount

* We can see the status of the student, we can see their name, ID, courses enrolled and balance at the end
